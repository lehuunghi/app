/**
 * The handoff, from the tab's side. The worker's half cannot be exercised here
 * -- sw.js is copied to the build rather than imported, and there is no service
 * worker under a test runner -- so what is stood up below is the cache it
 * writes into, keyed and shaped exactly as `stashShare` leaves it.
 *
 * That shape is the contract between two files that never see each other, and
 * it is the thing worth pinning: a drift on either side is silent. Nothing
 * errors, a share simply arrives at an empty composer.
