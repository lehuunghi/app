 * renewal added one, every start inside the renewal window added another, and

 * Now:
 *
 * - the same endpoint as last time, already registered: extend the newest one
 *   when it is close to expiring, and remove any extra copies;
 * - anything else -- a new endpoint, nothing registered, an extension the
 *   server refused: remove this browser's old ones and register afresh.
 *
 * A registration refused for `overQuota` makes room among other browsers'
 * subscriptions (`roomToMake`) and is tried once more.
 *
 * The local subscription is created when it is missing rather than only reused.
 * A browser may drop or rotate one on its own -- a `pushsubscriptionchange`
 * nobody was open to hear -- and the version that only reused an existing one
 * gave up there, leaving push off for good with the switch still saying it was
