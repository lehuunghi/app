 * as an untranslated word on screen, which somebody will eventually notice.
 *
 * A *stale* key -- one whose English no longer exists, usually because it was
 * mistyped when the catalog was written -- is silent. The translation sits
 * in the file looking correct, is never looked up, and the app renders English

 *
 * TypeScript 7 is the native port: its package ships a `tsc` shim over a Go
 * binary and nothing else, so `typescript` now exports `version` and
 * `versionMajorMinor` and no compiler API at all. Every `ts.createSourceFile`
 * in this directory started throwing "Cannot read properties of undefined
 * (reading 'Latest')" the day the bump landed, and nothing noticed, because no
 * workflow runs these.
 *
 * `typescript-ast` is an npm alias for the last TypeScript that carries the JS
 * API (see package.json). It parses; `typescript` still type-checks and builds.
 * Two entries, two jobs -- not a version someone forgot to remove.

 * untranslated string.
 *
